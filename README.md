# Python executor

This is a C hand-made tool that reads a "python-syntaxed" [input.py](./input.py) file and executes the instruction written inside, as if it was executed directly with python.

This project does not have any practical use, it's just something I wanted to try to challenge and improve my knowledge about the C language and data types.

Obviously, the program does not implement the whole python language... that would be toooo much for a free-time project.
You can find the list of implemented functions in the file [SUPPORTED-FEATURES.md](./SUPPORTED-FEATURES.md).

There may also be some bugs on that, I inserted all the tests I did inside the [Tested scripts](./Tested%20scripts/) folder.
